# Briefing

You will have to find the following information and test them as you go along in your program to experiment and understand how TypeScript will help you write your best code!

## Level 1

- Which are the different primitive data types in TypeScript? --> precicer le nombre et les principales
  The different primitive data are: string, number, boolean, symbol, null, undefined and bigint.
  Les principales:string, number, boolean, null, undefined.

- How to type an Array?
  The array is declared: --> let nameOfArray : typeOfArray[] = [input value of array]
  TS infere the array, TS understand it's an array when i write --> let nameOfArray=[input a value (possibility with different type)].

- What is the `any` type?
  The any type is the all of type; after the value is defined, the type is defined.
  Never use any (sinon il n'y aura pas d'erreur de type de dÃ©tectÃ©).

- How to type the return of a function as well as the type of its parameters?
  I can return the function with on function "return ..." and the type after parenthesis() --> nameOfClass():input type of return.

## Level 2

- What is a class? --> crÃ©Ã©e la boÃ®te typÃ©e qui peut Ãª rÃ©utilisÃ©e? --> traduire!
  The class is faÃ§on de dÃ©finir la forme d'un objet, moyen de regrouper des donnÃ©es, des fonctionnalitÃ©s et de definir une structure Ã  des objets
  For use when i want use. Ajout de type, de visibilitÃ© vis Ã  vis de JS.

- What is a class constructor? --> autorise la construction d'objet, enregistre la boÃ®te? stock?
  The constructor methode qui initialise les propriÃ©tÃ©s(attributs) de l'objet crÃ©e dans la classe, c'est lui qui est appelÃ© lors de la crÃ©ation d'une instance et il offre aussi la possibilitÃ© de personnaliser l'Ã©tat initial de l'objet
  Just one constructor on one class
  ex: je px modifier l'Ã©lement [0] d'un array an ecrivant thi.name[0]= name("cerise"), ce qui vient remplacer mon pomme par example.

- What is a class instance? --> creation d'un objet ma boite class specifique
  It is the instanciation and she can phone a method.

- How to check that a class is of a certain instance?
  I can check this when my mouse hover on my class with VSC; or with a console.log( nomDeLaSousBoite instanceOf nomDeLaClasse)
  When it's ok, return true.

- What is `this` in a class?
  Allow to refer to, to selected
  The 'this' init the properties, for take into account

- What is a class method?
  She can influence the properties of instances

- What is the visibility of properties?
  The visibility determinate the accessibilty of the attribut.

- What is the difference between `public`, `private` and `protected`?
  This properties defined the visibility of the attribut.
  public= access everywhere of class
  private= access uniquely in class (not possible with the child)
  protected= access in class and in child of his parents'class

## Level 3

- How to split our program into different files? (e.g. a class in a file that I import into another)
  I can split my program on different files with the export and import instruction; with precise on the concernate class.
- What is the `export` keyword?
  It is the instruction are whrite in the class to take
- What is the `import` keyword?
  It is the instruction
- What's inheritance?
- How to call the constructor of a parent class?
- How to call a method of a parent class?
- What is polymorphism?

## Boss level

You've learned a lot of things! Now it's time to put it into practice through this exercise in pairs!

### Part 1 : Heroes

Create a `Hero` class that allows you to create objects with the following properties:

```ts
name: string;
power: number;
life: number;
```

And the methods

```ts
  attack(opponent: Hero)
  isAlive()
```

The `attack` method has an `opponent` parameter (of type `Hero`). It is necessary to reduce the number (`life`) of `opponent` by as much damage (`power`) of the attacker.

â€‹*Example: If the Joan instance, attacks the Leon instance, it will be represented by this method call:*

```ts
joan.attack(leon);
```

The `isAlive` method should return `true` if the hero's life points are greater than zero and `false` otherwise.

Create two instances of `Hero` and check that the `attack` and `isAlive` methods work.

**Constraint to add**: you now have to make sure that the `name`, `power`, `life` properties are private. You will have to create methods to access their value and modify their value.

### Part 2 : Weapons

â€‹
Create a `Weapon` class with the following property:

```ts
name: string;
```

Add the `weapon` attribute (of type `Weapon`) to the `Hero` class without modifying the constructor (so `weapon` is not initialized).

Create three classes `HeroAxe`, `HeroSword` and `HeroSpear` that inherit from `Hero`.

These three classes call the constructor of their parent and initialize `weapon` with instances of the `Weapon` class whose names will be `axe`, `sword` or `spear` as the case may be.

In the `HeroAxe`, `HeroSword` and `HeroSpear` classes, redefine the `attack` method to take into account the following cases:

- `HeroAxe` : if the type of `opponent` is `HeroSword`, multiply `power` by two
- `HeroSword` : if the type of `opponent` is `HeroSpear`, multiply `power` by two
- `HeroSpear` : if the type of `opponent` is `HeroAxe`, multiply `power` by two

Tip: use the `super` keyword to call the `attack` method of the parent class.
â€‹
Create instances of the three classes `HeroAxe`, `HeroSword` and `HeroSpear` and check that their `attack` methods work correctly.
â€‹

### Part 3 : Battle

Create a loop that makes two instances of subclasses `Hero` fight each other (they attack at the same time).

When at least one of them is dead, display `{heroName} wins`. If both are dead, display `It's a draw`.

---

**_Bonus 1 : Weapon damage_**

_Add a `damage` property to the `Weapon` class and make sure it is initialized by the constructor._

_Edit the `attack` method of `Hero` so that the damage is calculated as follows: the hero's power `power` + the weapon's damage `power`_

**_Bonus 2 : User interface_**

_Create a user interface for the application (for example, with a choice of heroes and weapons, and a visual on the damage inflicted)_
